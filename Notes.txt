To Do for SnL:

Formulate toggling after roll. 

using P.findOne({canRoll: true}), roll and amend first score, then set to false, after that check if findOne({canRoll: true}) is true. If undefined, then reset all players and their canRolls to be True.


The application will support exactly 4 players.
There will be availability of snakes and ladders.
At any one time, no 2 players would have identical scores.

Hmm... how to make availability of snakes and ladders....
Each square is a function? Or maybe just a dictionary of snakes and or ladders. E.g. {3:2, 6:-2, 7:4}. so if value is in the dictionary, will update score again by value. If not, then no change.

To check if 2 players have identical scores, before amending check if any player has the same score. maybe can use a while loop in case consequetive scores. If same score, add the new one by 1. yes while loop.

while (P.findOne({score: newscore}))
	score += 1

When someone's score reaches 100, reset button appears, and roll button disappears. Winning announcement also made.

Left with fixing the reset button and declaration of winner
